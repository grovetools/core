# Documentation Task: API Reference Page

## Task
Create a page that directs developers to the Go package documentation for the `grove-core` API reference. Do NOT generate the API reference itself.

## Content
- Explain that the definitive API reference is the Go documentation, generated from source code comments.
- Provide a link to the `grove-core` package on `pkg.go.dev`: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mattsolo1/grove-core
- Briefly explain how to navigate the documentation, showing how to find packages like `cli`, `config`, and `logging`.
- Mention that standard Go development environments will provide inline documentation and auto-completion based on the source code comments.
